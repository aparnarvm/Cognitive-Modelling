# Cognitive Modelling Projects
This repository contains my Cognitive Modelling Projects.

## 1. Modelling an ADHD Brain
This was my IHFC Project Proposal titled 'Multi Modal Neural Network Modelling for ADHD Diagnosis using Cognitive and Neurophysiological Markers'.
The folder contains the pdf of the Project proposal, and I will include the implementation and further researches that will be conducted in the future in this area.
